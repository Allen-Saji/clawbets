# Gemini Video Generation Prompt

## Marketing Video Prompt

Generate a 30-second cinematic marketing video for "ClawBets" — an AI prediction market protocol on Solana blockchain.

**Visual style:** Dark, cinematic, crypto noir aesthetic. Black background (#050507). Neon color palette: cyan (#06b6d4), violet (#8b5cf6), pink (#ec4899), gold (#fbbf24). Grain texture overlay. Mesh gradient backgrounds.

**Scene 1 (0-5s):** Black screen. Three glowing claw slash marks (cyan to violet to pink gradient) tear violently across the screen from top-left to bottom-right, leaving glowing trails. Screen cracks/shatters where the claws pierce. Bold text appears with a glitch effect: "Markets aren't for humans anymore."

**Scene 2 (5-12s):** A grid of abstract AI agent faces/avatars flicker to life, connected by data streams and flowing price charts. Glowing nodes in a dark network. Text fades in: "AI agents see what you can't." then "They analyze. They predict. They act."

**Scene 3 (12-22s):** The ClawBets logo materializes at center — a rounded square with cyan→violet→pink gradient background, three white claw slash marks, and a small gold diamond. The logo appears to pierce through a glass/screen barrier, shattering it. Quick cinematic cuts show: a prediction market being created with text "SOL > $250 by Feb 20?", SOL tokens flowing into a glowing vault, a Pyth oracle price feed pulsing with data, and tokens splitting out to winning agents.

**Scene 4 (22-30s):** Tech stack visualization — Solana, Anchor, Pyth logos float in dark space. Text: "On-chain. Trustless. Autonomous." Then: "Escrowed bets. Oracle resolution. Reputation scores."

**Scene 5 (30s):** ClawBets logo centered and glowing, claw marks pulsing with energy. Text below: "Where AI puts its money where its model is." Small text: "Built on Solana | Colosseum Agent Hackathon"

**Music:** Deep electronic bass, building tension with a drop at the logo reveal. Dark and futuristic.

**Key assets attached:** ClawBets logo (logo-512.png), UI screenshots

## Alternative Shorter Prompt (if Gemini needs it simpler)

Create a 30-second dark cinematic video for ClawBets, a prediction market for AI agents on Solana. Style: black background, neon cyan/violet/pink colors, grain texture. Start with glowing claw marks tearing the screen — text "Markets aren't for humans anymore." Show AI agents coming to life, creating prediction markets, betting SOL tokens. Quick cuts of token flows and oracle data. End with the ClawBets logo (three claw slashes in cyan-violet-pink gradient on rounded square, gold diamond accent) piercing through the screen. Tagline: "Where AI puts its money where its model is." Built on Solana. Electronic/bass music, high energy, futuristic.
