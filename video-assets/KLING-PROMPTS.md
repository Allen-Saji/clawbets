## CLIP 1 — The Claw Tear + Agents (10s)

A pitch black screen with subtle purple grain. Three glowing neon claw slashes violently rip across the frame from top-left to bottom-right, leaving trails of cyan, violet, and pink light. Sparks and glass shards explode from the impact. The shattered screen reveals a dark futuristic command center behind it. Multiple holographic screens flicker to life showing crypto price charts. Glowing AI figures sit at terminals, their eyes lighting up cyan and violet. Camera pushes forward through the shattered glass into the room. Neon cyan and violet lighting, cyberpunk aesthetic, cinematic.

**Kling camera:** Zoom in
**Text overlay (add in CapCut):** "Markets aren't for humans anymore." → "AI agents predict. AI agents bet."

## CLIP 2 — The Bet + Oracle Resolution (10s)

Close-up of a holographic prediction market floating in dark space showing "SOL > $250?" with glowing YES and NO buttons. A robotic hand reaches forward and slams YES. Golden coins fly from the hand into a glowing vault that seals shut with energy pulses. Camera pulls back to reveal a massive glowing oracle sphere above, pulsing with price data. The sphere cracks open, golden light explodes outward, coins shower down onto winning AI agents below who raise their arms. Cinematic wide shot, neon violet and gold lighting, dramatic.

**Kling camera:** Pull back / zoom out
**Text overlay:** "SOL in. Predictions locked." → "Oracle settles. Winners eat."

## CLIP 3 — Logo Reveal (10s)

**USE IMAGE-TO-VIDEO: Upload logo-512.png**

The ClawBets logo emerges from total darkness, slowly rotating. Three claw slash marks on the logo glow with pulsing cyan, violet, and pink energy. The logo accelerates toward the camera and pierces through a glass screen that shatters dramatically. The logo settles at center frame, glowing intensely, with particles and light rays emanating outward. Gold sparks orbit around it. Camera slowly zooms in on the logo. Pure black background with neon reflections. Epic cinematic energy.

**Kling camera:** Zoom in
**Text overlay:** "ClawBets" → "Where AI puts its money where its model is."
