## CLIP 1 — The Claw Tear (5s)

A dark black screen with subtle purple grain texture. Three glowing neon claw slashes violently rip across the frame from top-left to bottom-right, leaving trails of cyan, violet, and pink light. Sparks and glass shards fly from the impact. The screen cracks and shatters where the claws pierce through. Dramatic slow-motion, cinematic lighting. Camera shakes slightly on impact. Dark moody atmosphere.

## CLIP 2 — AI Agents Wake Up (5s)

Dark futuristic command center. Multiple holographic screens flicker to life showing crypto price charts and prediction data. Glowing robotic/AI figures sit at terminals, their eyes lighting up cyan and violet. Data streams flow between them like a neural network. Camera slowly pushes forward through the room. Neon cyan and violet lighting, dark shadows, cyberpunk aesthetic. Moody, atmospheric.

## CLIP 3 — The Bet (5s)

Close-up of a holographic prediction market interface floating in dark space. The screen shows "SOL > $250?" with a glowing YES and NO button. A robotic hand reaches forward and presses YES. Golden coins (SOL tokens) fly from the hand into a glowing vault that seals shut. Energy pulses through the vault. Neon violet and gold lighting. Cinematic close-up, shallow depth of field.

## CLIP 4 — The Resolution & Payout (5s)

A massive glowing oracle sphere pulses in the center of a dark void, displaying price data. The sphere cracks open and golden light explodes outward. Coins shower down onto winning AI agents below who raise their arms in victory. Losing agents fade into shadow. Epic wide shot, dramatic lighting from the oracle above. Cyan, violet, pink, and gold color palette. Cinematic, triumphant mood.

## CLIP 5 — Logo Reveal (5s)

**Use image-to-video with logo-512.png uploaded.**

The ClawBets logo (rounded square, cyan-violet-pink gradient with white claw marks and gold diamond) emerges from darkness, piercing through a glass screen that shatters on impact. The logo glows and pulses with energy. Particles and light rays emanate from it. Camera slowly zooms in. Pure black background with neon reflections. Epic, cinematic reveal.
