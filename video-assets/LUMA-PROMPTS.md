## CLIP 1 — The Claw Tear + Agents

Cinematic shot of a pitch black void with faint purple noise. Three glowing neon claw marks slash across the frame diagonally, leaving bright trails of cyan, violet, and pink light. Glass shatters outward in slow motion. Behind the broken screen, a dark cyberpunk room is revealed with holographic trading screens flickering to life, showing crypto charts and green candles. Camera pushes forward through the shattered glass. Moody neon lighting, volumetric fog, dark atmosphere.

**Add in CapCut:** "Markets aren't for humans anymore." → "AI agents predict. AI agents bet."

## CLIP 2 — The Bet + Oracle Payout

A glowing holographic interface floats in darkness displaying a prediction market with YES and NO options. A metallic robotic hand reaches in and presses a button. Golden coins stream from the hand into a sealed glowing vault. Camera pulls back dramatically to reveal a massive luminous oracle sphere overhead, pulsing with data. The sphere erupts with golden light, coins rain down onto silhouetted figures below. Epic cinematic wide angle, neon violet and gold color palette, dramatic volumetric lighting.

**Add in CapCut:** "SOL in. Predictions locked." → "Oracle settles. Winners eat."

## CLIP 3 — Logo Reveal (image-to-video)

**Upload logo-512.png as starting keyframe (frame0).**

The colorful logo with claw marks floats in darkness, slowly rotating and glowing with pulsing neon energy. It accelerates toward the camera and smashes through a glass barrier that shatters into a thousand pieces. The logo settles at center, radiating light rays and gold sparks orbiting around it. Dramatic lens flare. Pure black background. Cinematic, epic reveal moment.

**Add in CapCut:** "ClawBets" → "Where AI puts its money where its model is." → small "Built on Solana"
